# Airline Satisfaction Prediction Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Airline Satisfaction Prediction Project! This project aims to analyze and predict customer satisfaction with airlines based on a dataset available on Kaggle. You will perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Plotly, build predictive models using KNN, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, and showcase your results through a Streamlit app.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Airline Passenger Satisfaction" dataset, which can be downloaded from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction/data). **For this project, you will specifically use the `train.csv` file.** The dataset contains information about airline passengers, including features such as flight distance, seat comfort, inflight entertainment, and more.
